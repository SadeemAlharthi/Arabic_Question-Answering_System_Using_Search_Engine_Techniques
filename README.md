A wide variety of natural language processing experts have tried to work on it to understand its linguistic complexity. When we consider text processing and its applications we surely come across question answering systems. In this paper, we organized the data in the System of Labor in the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development into a free form-based format is available to be used also, we are presenting a question answering system for the system of labor laws in Saudi Arabia dataset, our system works by retrieving the relevant information to a user based search query.
